        "The Microsoft Surface Pro 7  did not reinvent its Windows-tablet predecessors when it launched in 2019, but instead iterated on a time-tested design by delivering better performance and adding a USB Type-C port. Almost a year and a half later, here in 2021, it remains the alpha dog among 2-in-1 detachables. A handful of competitors have come for the crown (full support for its Surface stablemate, the Surface Pro X, never quite materialized), and bending, non-detaching 2-in-1 convertible laptops are worthy alternatives. But the Surface Pro design is still our favorite among pure detachables. (A model with updated components, the Surface Pro 7+, is also now available; more about that in a bit.) The physical design is showing its age somewhat—we anticipate a new-look version next time around—but it still has strong tablet chops. If you're looking for a less expensive 2-in-1 to use when working in what passes for mobile fashion these days, shuttling from room to room instead of airport to airport, the Pro 7 is the go-to in its category for a reason. Mostly, that's a good thing. The magnesium-alloy design feels high quality, and it's a relatively compact and sleek device. It measures 0.33 by 11.5 by 7.9 inches (HWD) and weighs 1.7 pounds—a very portable machine no matter how you slice it. For comparison, the XPS 13 2-in-1 comes in at 0.51 by 11.7 by 8.2 inches and 2.9 pounds, and shows itself as a laptop first. On its own, the Pro 7's platinum-colored industrial look hasn't aged badly, even though I did grow fond of the Pro 6's black paint job. The bezels are still pretty thick, a fact that's becoming more obvious as virtually every slim laptop opts for razor-thin ones. The Surface Pro 7 still looks slick, but the problem is becoming the context, and it's an issue, at least in part, created by Microsoft itself. By 2021's standards, the design is looking a bit dated, especially the thick screen bezels. This was made more obvious by the emergence of the Surface Pro X, originally revealed alongside the Pro 7. The Pro X boasts the slimmer, rounder edges and thinner bezels that you might expect out of a contemporary top-tier Surface Pro device. When the two are next to each other, the Pro X looks decidedly more modern. It's a gorgeous system, inducing that feeling of tech envy that has slowly gone missing in the main line.",

        "Certain aspects of the Xiaomi 11 ultra design have some similarities with phones from Oppo and Realme, and I'm not surprised, considering they are all part of the same family. It's still recognisable as a modern OnePlus phone, since it has the alert slider, a similar layout for the buttons and ports, and no headphone jack. The build quality is very good for a phone with a polycarbonate body. There's Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back, which is reassuring. I quite like the Blue Marble colour on the Nord unit that I've been using, as it looks refreshingly new. There's also a more subdued Grey Onyx colour. There's no option to expand the internal storage on the OnePlus Nord, as the SIM tray only supports two nano-SIM cards. This shouldn't be an issue on the 128GB and 256GB variants, but those buying the 64GB variant might fall short of storage after a year or so, depending on usage. OnePlus offers 50GB of free cloud storage for a year if you sign up for its Red Cable Club. OnePlus smartphones are known for their AMOLED displays and I'm happy to see that this hasn't been compromised on the lower priced OnePlus Nord. The sides of the display aren't curved like they are on the OnePlus 8, but there is a cutout for two selfie cameras, instead of one. The screen measures 6.44 inches, and has a full-HD+ resolution (1080x2400) along with a 90Hz refresh rate. You also get the usual options to tweak the colours and mask the camera hole with a black strip, if needed. Unlike the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro, the OnePlus Nord's display doesn't have any colour accuracy certifications, but it does support HDR10+. It's a good-looking panel overall, with deep blacks and punchy colours. There's a mild shift in colour tone on white backgrounds, which I noticed initially and it didn't go away even after a few updates. Still, you'd have to be a real astute observer to notice it. The OnePlus Nord ships with the usual set of accessories that we've come to expect from a RedMi phone. There's a silicone bumper case, a Type-C cable, a fast charger, and of course, stickers.",

        "The Redmi Note 9 Pro has a lower starting price than its predecessors, but also doesn't offer all the modern features that you might expect. The Redmi Note 9 Pro has just been launched in India, and its starting price of Rs. 12,999 is surprisingly low because Xiaomi has made a few very interesting decisions in terms of positioning and features. It isn't easy to stay ahead of the game, and the Redmi Note 9 Pro goes up against the formidable Realme 6 and Samsung M30s. Longtime fans of the series might be surprised at how Xiaomi has actually held back a little with this model, since expectations are always when a new generation of Redmi Note smartphones is announced.It has a 6.67-inch LCD screen with a 60Hz refresh rate and hole-punch front camera at the top. The processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 720G which is surprisingly powerful for this segment. You also get a 5020mAh battery and suppport for 18W fast charging. The Redmi Note 9 Pro is powerful and everyday work will go smoothly. The display is large and crisp, making games and movies look good. You have a choice between variants, one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, and the other with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The 48-megapixel primary camera was slightly disappointing overall, particularly in low light. There's also an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 5-megapixel macro camera, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. On the front you get a 16-megapixel selfie camera. ",

        "Certain aspects of the OnePlus Nord's design have some similarities with phones from Oppo and Realme, and I'm not surprised, considering they are all part of the same family. It's still recognisable as a modern OnePlus phone, since it has the alert slider, a similar layout for the buttons and ports, and no headphone jack. The build quality is very good for a phone with a polycarbonate body. There's Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back, which is reassuring. I quite like the Blue Marble colour on the Nord unit that I've been using, as it looks refreshingly new. There's also a more subdued Grey Onyx colour. There's no option to expand the internal storage on the OnePlus Nord, as the SIM tray only supports two nano-SIM cards. This shouldn't be an issue on the 128GB and 256GB variants, but those buying the 64GB variant might fall short of storage after a year or so, depending on usage. OnePlus offers 50GB of free cloud storage for a year if you sign up for its Red Cable Club. OnePlus smartphones are known for their AMOLED displays and I'm happy to see that this hasn't been compromised on the lower priced OnePlus Nord. The sides of the display aren't curved like they are on the OnePlus 8, but there is a cutout for two selfie cameras, instead of one. The screen measures 6.44 inches, and has a full-HD+ resolution (1080x2400) along with a 90Hz refresh rate. You also get the usual options to tweak the colours and mask the camera hole with a black strip, if needed. Unlike the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro, the OnePlus Nord's display doesn't have any colour accuracy certifications, but it does support HDR10+. It's a good-looking panel overall, with deep blacks and punchy colours. There's a mild shift in colour tone on white backgrounds, which I noticed initially and it didn't go away even after a few updates. Still, you'd have to be a real astute observer to notice it. The OnePlus Nord ships with the usual set of accessories that we've come to expect from a OnePlus phone. There's a silicone bumper case, a Type-C cable, a fast charger, and of course, stickers.",

      "The iPhone 13 doesn’t seem very new when you first look at it. But when you start using this flagship, you realize that it delivers a lot more than a smaller notch. The new iPhone’s display is brighter than its predecessor’s. The battery life is longer. And Apple has improved an already great camera with new sensors and computational photography features that make you feel like a pro (even on a non-Pro phone). Yes, the A15 Bionic powering the iPhone 13 is once again the fastest chip in the land. But it’s more about what this chip lets you do. This includes Cinematic mode, which adds depth of field to your videos while automatically shifting focus, and Photographic Styles for changing the look of your pics. Honestly, the smaller notch doesn’t make much of a difference in day-to-day use of the iPhone 13. When watching videos in landscape mode side by side at full-screen, I didn’t find either notch that distracting. I did appreciate the mini notch more when using apps with a white background in portrait orientation, such as Gmail. However, the notch on the iPhone 13 mini swoops down a bit more despite being narrower.",

        "This is one of the simplest reviews I’ve ever had to write: the iPhone 11 is the phone most people who are upgrading to a new iPhone this year should get. It’s an excellent phone, with one of the best cameras I’ve ever seen on a smartphone and terrific battery life. Apple’s also dropped the price by 50 bucks: the iPhone XR started at $749, but the iPhone 11 starts at $699. None of this means the iPhone 11 is a perfect phone or that it has all of the best specs and features you can get. It doesn’t. But it’s great where it counts, and it’s totally fine everywhere else. If you want to live on the bleeding edge of tech, you can spend $300 more and get an iPhone 11 Pro, which I also reviewed this week, or look at one of the many high-end Android options available. But most people don’t need to overthink it: just get an iPhone 11. You’ll be happy. Here’s why. If you’ve been holding off upgrades and aren’t familiar with the iPhone XR, here’s a quick catch-up: the iPhone XR was the lower-cost model in Apple’s 2018 line of iPhones, swapping in an LCD screen for the OLED in the iPhone XS. It also had one fewer camera, but, critically, Apple didn’t skimp anywhere else — plus the battery life was stellar. Despite not having the best specs, it was the best iPhone for most people, and it quickly became Apple’s best-selling model. That’s probably why this year’s XR upgrade is just called the “iPhone 11.” The only major differences between the iPhone XR and the iPhone 11 are the cameras, the slightly better battery life, and the processor. There’s a bunch of other little things we’ll get to, but that’s what you really need to know. Let’s start with the battery.",
